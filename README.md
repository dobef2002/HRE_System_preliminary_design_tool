# HRE_System_preliminary_design_tool
Preliminary design tool for hybrid rocket engine system with genetic algorithm optimation. 
#
function:
Find design specification with dV or mass ratio optimation condition.
This proces includes all components preliminary design and sizing with input design variables, then try to find a compact way of components arrangement with max vehicle delta velocity or max mass ratio.
#
input design variable:
action time, chamber pressure, fuel grin diameter ratio for circlur shape, nozzle expansion ratio, O/F ratio, thrust, gas tank pressure, arrangement of all components
with appropriate value range.
#
output:
Find a set of design variable with max vehicle delta velocity or max mass ratio of the engine.
Then the preliminary design procced with those design data.
